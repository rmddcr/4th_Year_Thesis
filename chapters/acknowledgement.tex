Many thanks to my beloved mother and my dear father for always being my
strength, showing me the correct direction, and making me who I am today. This
thesis is dedicated to all my family members, to primary and secondary school
teachers, to lecturers of University of Colombo School of Computing and to anyone
who supported even by words to make my dreams come true.
